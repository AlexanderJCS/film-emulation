# film-emulation
A little experiment to emulate the look of film from a digital image


* TODO
  * Monte carlo film grain
  * Documentation
  * Write an article about this
  * Discuss limitation: the LUT I use converts from Apple ProRes Log -> Rec. 709 SDR, which removes HDR data that would otherwise be very helpful
